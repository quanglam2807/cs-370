21. What are generics? Why are they convenient?
- A generic class (or a generic) is usually a container of some type.
- Generics let programmers re-use classes, especially classes that are designed as data structures like maps and vectors.

22. What is a template? How do you declare a vector in C++?
- A template is how C++ programmers write generic classes. 
- In C++ you can declare a vector of int if you need to by writing
vector<type> nameOfVector;

23. What is auto-boxing and unboxing?
- Auto-boxing means wrapping primitive types inside their associates classes so they can can serve as arguments to generics (because Java doesn't allow primitive types to serve as arguments).
- Unboxing means unwrapping the associates classes back to primitive types.

24. How is a function represented as a value in Java?
- Java does not treat functions and methods as values but a class can simulate a function or method. So functions are represented as classes.

25. What is an anonymous class?
- An anonymous class is a class without name.

26. What is the type(6) in JCoCo and Python? How about the type(type(6))? How
about the type(type(type(6)))? Why isnâ€™t it interesting to go any further?
- type(6) is type<int>.
- type(type(6)) and type(type(type(6))) is type<type>.
- It isn't interesting to go any further because type of type<type> is just type<type>. So if we go further, we will get the same result again and again.

27. The JCoCo scanner is based on a finite state machine. How is the finite state machine implemented? What are the major constructs used by a finite state
machine?
- The finite state machine consists of states and transitions between states depending on the characters read from the input file. The finite state machine accepts tokens of the CASM file.

28. Does the JCoCo parser run bottom-up or top-down?
- JCoCo parser runs top-down

29. In JCoCo how are a PyCode object and a PyFunction object related?
- PyCode objects are used to build PyFunction objects.

30. What is a traceback and why is it important?
- The traceback is a list of all the PyFrame objects that are popped until an exception handler is found.
- It is important because traceback allows programmers to track down the sources of errors.

31. What is the purpose of a PyMethod class?
- PyMethod class implements calling a method (which are all PyFunctions found in the attrs variable) on an object.

32. Arriving at hash values for hashable objects in Java is trivial. Describe how
JCoCo determines hash values for objects in the implementation of PyDict objects.
- JCoCo determines hash values for objects in the implementation of PyDict objects using HashMap, part of the utility library of Java (calling __hash__ magic method).
