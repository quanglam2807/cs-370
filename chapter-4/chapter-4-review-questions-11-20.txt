11. Which environment has garbage collection built in, C++ or Java?
- Java has garbage collection built it but C++ doesn't.

12. What are the advantages of garbage collection?
- Garbage collection automatically takes care of managing and freeing unused memory which saves programmers' time to manage it manually.

13. Are there any drawbacks to garbage collection?
- Garbage collection can lead to the possibility of memory leaks.
- Garbage collection can impact the run-time performance of a system.
- Run-time system that supports garbage collection has less access to the underlying hardware of the machine (or in other words, programmers have less control).

14. What is a destructor and when is it needed?
- Destructors are a feature of C++ that help programmers prevent memory leaks.
- It is needed when take care of cleaning up instances of itself (i.e. objects of the class) when they are freed (as opposed to constructor).

15. What do you have to write to get a polymorphic method in C++?
- To get a polymorphic method in C++, we use virtual function table.
- When a virtual function is called, there is an extra lookup of the functionâ€™s address because classes that inherit from this class may override any of the virtual functions.

16. What is the purpose of polymorphism?
- Polymorphism is the mechanism we employ to customize the behavior of code we have already written. 

17. What is the purpose of inheritance?
- Inheritance is the mechanism we employ to re-use code in software we are currently writing.

18. How do interfaces and classes differ in Java? How are they similar? How are
they different?
- An interface is a promise to support certain methods in a class.
- Classes can implement as many interfaces as they wish, which is the Java way of achieving multiple inheritance. 
- Interfaces are in no way tied to the class hierarchy.

19. What is an adapter class? Why are they useful?
- Adapter class is a class that implements the interface and provides common code to several subclasses.
- It is useful when multiple classes share identical interface.

20. What is a callback and how are they usually implemented in Java?
- A callback in java is a method that gets called when an event occurs.
- They are usually implemented in Java using anonymous inner classes.
